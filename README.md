# A-Comprehensive-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Water-Quality-Prediction-with-the-H2O-Framework
This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to predict water quality, focusing on classifying water as potable or non-potable. Using a comprehensive dataset, we pre-process and analyze data with Big Data tools such as Apache Spark and H2O.
