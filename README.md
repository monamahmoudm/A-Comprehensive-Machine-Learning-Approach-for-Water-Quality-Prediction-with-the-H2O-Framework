# A-Comprehensive-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Water-Quality-Prediction-with-the-H2O-Framework

This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to predict water quality, focusing on classifying water as potable or non-potable. Using a comprehensive dataset, we pre-process and analyze data with Big Data tools such as Apache Spark and H2O. Our framework integrates ML and DL models to improve prediction accuracy, addressing challenges such as data imbalance and missing values. This research aims to improve the monitoring of water quality and environmental sustainability.

# Introduction
Water is one of the most essential resources for sustaining life, economic activities, and ecosystem balance. The degradation of water quality has become a major global environmental issue that affects the stability of ecosystems, human health, and economic growth. The management of water resources and the preservation of the environment depend on the efficient identification and control of the impact factors on water quality. Potable water refers to water suitable for human consumption. Due to climate change, rapid urbanization, rising food demand, and the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, nearly 40% of the global population now faces water scarcity and are unable to access potable water. Contaminants such as heavy metals, nitrates, phosphates, and microbial pollutants pose severe health and environmental risks. As a result, accurate and timely water quality prediction has become a critical area of research to support sustainable water management, pollution control, and public health safety. According to Wu et al, the current research is roughly divided into three types: traditional statistical method prediction, artificial intelligence method prediction and hybrid model method prediction. Traditional models rely on statistical analysis and deterministic equations, but they often struggle with the nonlinear and complex nature of water pollution patterns. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have shown great promise in capturing intricate relationships between various water quality indicators. Hybrid models aim to leverage the strengths of both approaches, improving predictive accuracy and generalizability. This paper explores the application of big data and machine learning methodologies in predicting water quality. By analyzing existing literature and datasets, we aim to assess the effectiveness of different predictive models and highlight the advantages and limitations of each approach. Through this research, we seek to contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient water quality monitoring systems, ultimately promoting public health and environmental sustainability.

# Chosen Dataset
We used a dataset provided on Kaggle and can be accessed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanthanadevi08/water-quality-prediction/data). This dataset represents different indicators including its nutrients, color, air and water temperature for measuring the water quality. All these variables are aligned with the date and time these indicators were getting measured. The dataset has 1,048,575 observations with 22 variables to be observed. Out of the 22 there are 3 categorical variables, while the rest are numeric. In addition to that, there is a target variable that identifies whether the water is potable or not.
